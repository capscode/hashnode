## How I Made Covid-19 Vaccine Search Portal in ReactJS

Hello Everyone,

I just wanted to share one of my recent work which is a vaccine search/ tracker portal with **GOOGLE VOICE ENABLED** to update the status of vaccine availability.
In this Web App you can search for vaccine availability by entering your **PIN CODE** or by entering your **STATE & DISTRICT**.
It refreshed every after every 40 mins and a fresh data is being shown in the page and if the vaccine gets available in the selected location, the VOICE ASSISTENT will notify about that.

If the vaccine is available you will GREEN color list and if vaccine is not available you will see red colored list, you can click on these list to directly navigate to the govt portal to book your vaccination slots.

Link for the portal :  [https://searchvaccine.netlify.app/#/](https://searchvaccine.netlify.app/#/) 

This webapp is completely based on ReactJS,
API used is COWIN API provided by the Indian Govt.,
AXIOS for fetching the data,
and Material UI for designing.



You can also contribute to this just by forking the code from my github link and giving me a star there.
